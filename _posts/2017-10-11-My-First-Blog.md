   This year I have started playing the piano. I sadly won't be able to do my grade one this year, as I have to finish this massive book which will teach me all about the things that I need to know about grade one piano examination. However, I may be able to do grade two quite quickly after that after finishing the book. In rugby recently, I have competed in a tournament, where my team and I lost all of our games, but we still played very well, the other teams said. In the rugby team at school we have been slightly more successful. I have also competed in lots of junior triathlons. I am also in the swimming squad. I am very sporty. I like to do art and play video games and football. I play on the xbox with my brother. He likes basketball and football. He also likes English and History. Talk more soon, but for now, bye!
